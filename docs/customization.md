# Customization

The Larafun Suite package comes with a good set of default behaviour. Even so, it allows the developer to easily customize a bunch of features.

In order to fine tune your setup, you first need to publish the package config file:

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider=Larafun\\Suite\\ServiceProvider`

Consult your `config/suite.php` file to discover and understand the various ways you can customize this package.
